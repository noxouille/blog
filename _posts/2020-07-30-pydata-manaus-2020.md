A little bit late to announce but better than never.
[My talk for PyData Manaus 2020](https://youtu.be/VXDU3nzFTTw?t=12572) has been published in YouTube (It is 20 mins talk in English with Portuguese subtitled, as it was mainly directed at Portuguese audiences) and in case you haven't check out my Github, the [hands-on lab for the talk](https://noxouille.github.io/pydata2020-3LVDL/) was already available since April 2020.

For those who is interested to learn vision deep learning but have no clue where to start, this is a good opportunity for you!

You will learn how to use Convolutional Neural Network with PyTorch to detect objects from an image level (image classification) to a pixel level (instance segmentation).
By the end of the talk, you should have a general idea of how a vision deep learning works and how it is useful in real life applications. Feel free to share it as well.

Constructive comments and feedbacks are very much welcome!
