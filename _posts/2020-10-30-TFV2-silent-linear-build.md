It is now the time to complete my Silent Linear build of TFV2.
If you are interested to read how I got into this hobby, [read the first part](https://ferdi.now.sh/mech-keebs-hobby/) of the series.
Direct links to each products are listed [here](https://kit.co/noxouille/tfv2-silent-linear-build).

Here are the following components:

- TFV2 Custom Mechanical Keyboard DIY Kit
  - E-White Aluminum Case + daughter boards
  - Brass plate and weight
  - DZ60RGB-ANSI V2 Hotswap PCB (USB-C)
  - Module foam
  - Case Foam
- Switches:
  - 20x Sakurios (62g Silent Linears)
  - 50x Roselios (67g Silent Linears)  
- Stabs: Zeal Transparent Gold Plated PCB Mount Screw-in stabs V2 (4x 2U, 1x 6.25U)
- Lubes: Krytox 205-G0
- Keycaps: Dye-Subbed Keycaps set (KBDFans)

The total average cost was a whoppin' 750$ CAD (incl. Tax, shipping and import fees).
I was a little bit overboard there, considering it is my first build.

I didn't expected to purchase E-white for my first build. In fact, I was going to take something more like navy blue or burgundy.
Given the circumstances, I was so happy I got the E-white instead. It looks so gorgeous!
Coincidentally it matches with my chair with an a two tone accent black-white.
The E-White Alu case is so underrated, which I think will be versatile when matched with many other Keycaps.

This is my first time ever with custom keyboards, and I think I made a great choice with the switches!
