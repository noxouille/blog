Staying productive in a work from home environment might be rather challenging, especially given the limited space and the tools available surrounding our working environment.
Inspired by as lot of people who have posted their WFH desk setup on social media, I also would like to share my desk setup and redefine productivity from my perspective.

Let's start with the desk! Having a lower back pain for quite a while now, I started to use a standing desk since the end of 2020, which is working great so far.  
What's even more challenging with a standing desk is the cable management, which is ~~a hidden ability of a selected individuals~~ an easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master kind of skill.

You see only 1 cable connected to the power source which goes to the bottom side of the tabletop, having all the stuffs fixed with cable ties (And no, I am not interested to use IKEA Signum cable tray).
I tried to avoid loose cable hanging as much as possible, which gives us the impression of secure and neat.
I also installed a cable raceway to hide some of the cables routing.

Back to the tabletop, I put my work equipment next to my PC.
My main workstation is a laptop-tablet hybrid which is connected to a dock via Thunderbolt connector.

Normally I use only 1 monitor and I personally don't like to be stared by multiple monitors. But there are circumstances when I need an extra display during a conference call or other demanding activities, and that's where the integrated display comes in.
Otherwise, I would just flip the tablet screen completely.

I use a deskmat to avoid scratches to the tabletop, and there's also a USB switcher to conveniently switch my peripherals between my PC and workstation. It gets tiring really quickly when I just want to use the same peripherals for multiple devices without the switcher.

I use a single monitor arm to free some of the real estate of the desk, and to avoid slouching due to the uncomfortable monitor position.
I also installed a small ambience lighting at the back of the monitor (No, it's not photoshopped).
And then there's my keyboard, mouse, and wireless headset.
Sometimes I use an external webcam for flexibility.

I try not to put anything else on the desk without a specific purpose, as it tends to be cluttered very quickly!

Hope that inspires you in the best possible way, to create your own setup and have an improved experience of work from home, stay safe and until next time!
